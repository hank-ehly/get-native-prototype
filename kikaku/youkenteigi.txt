			Q: How will you separate the user's collocations
				 from the recommended collocations?

• tutorial
	# A separate section of the website, 
		which exists to introduce the different 
		features of the website
	# User interaction is guided (the user doesn't have full control)
	# Progresses in chapters, so you can freely jump around

• quick study button (auto-select playlist video based on srs calculation)
	# Need a way to store user's previous activity information,
		and a way to access it
	# Need a function that processes user activity data,
		decide what contents to use in the study session,
		and redirect accordingly.. all on a click event

• 'recommend me a video' form where you can fill out information
	 like your interests, age group, gender to select videos for you 
	 # Need a way of picking out DB resources based on user form input
	 # Need a way and place to store data selected as a result of the users' form input
	 # Video resources must be classifiable by interests/age-group/gender

	(graded based on whether a native speaker would actually say that)
	# Need 'fill-in-the-blank-activity' resource
	# Need pre-graded answers
		Q: Will there be only 1 answer per blank?
			A: Probably not
		Q: Would it be possible for users to come up with an acceptable
			 answer not provided in the pre-defined answers?
			A: Yes
		Q: How will you decide whether or not a users' answer is acceptable?

• users can request a video to be made 
	in a certain language about a certain topic
	# Need a way to get user input about video topic suggestions

• conversation practice like Skype, you talk to the person in front
	of you while shadowing the responses, essentially ‘pretending’ 
	to be the person having the conversation..
	# You need a front-facing video of a person speaking half of a pre-recorded conversation
	# You need the audio of BOTH SIDES of the pre-recorded conversation
	# You need to sync the video with half of the pre-recorded conversation,
		while only playing the audio of the other half of the conversation

• select site language
	# You need translations of all static website content
	# You need to decide when to translate the site into a certain language (ip address?)
	# You need to allow users to set their language preferance, 
		and save that preference for their next visit

• if user is studying multiple languages, they can switch 
	between the languages they’re studying
	# Users can have muliple language 'modules'
	# Users can add, delete, switch between their 'modules'
	# There is 1 module per language

• 'login and go' feeling
	# If the 'study' feature is the main-attraction of the website,
		you need a way to quickly allow users to use the study feature.
			# See 'quick study button'

• guests can only see some videos
	# Need a way to distinguish between different types of users,
		including users who haven't even created an account yet

• search all videos for specific collocations **
	# Need a way to search for VIDEOS by the words in each video SCRIPT
		Q: That's a lot of words, bro..

• search videos by difficulty level (?)
	# Need to categorize videos based on easiness to understand

• you can slow down the video
	# Need a way to manipulate the video speed during playback

• place to download video / mp3
	# Video resources are downloadable
		Q: Who can download videos / audio?
			A: Non-guests
		Q: If you can download the videos, then you'll have to store the files privately, right?

• place to add your own collocations, then shows up in ‘your collocations’ section
	# User-created 'collocations' can be viewed in their own section of the website
	# The 'collocation' must be its own entity

• place to add this video to your list
	# User can group videos into their own 'list'
		Q: What if the user is studying multiple languages?
			A: Maybe, 1 list per language module?

• for recommended collocations, there is a brief description 
	# Each NON-user-created collocation entity has an associated description
		Q: What language will this description be written in?
			A: It would be nice to have the description written in all site-languages..
		Q: That's a lot of writing!

• Study --> progress through listening (warmup), shadowing, speaking, writing
	# There exists a separate section of the website for the 'study' feature
	# This section has a beginning and end
	# It is guided
		Q: Can you skip through, like the tutorial?
			A: 	1) Yes, but it affects your progress results
					2) No
		Q: If you can't skip around, and there's a bug that won't let the user finish,
			 are their progress statistics all lost?
			A: I would like to save them if possible, so it might be a better idea to update
				 progress results throughout the study exercise

• Study --> uninhibited by popups
	Q: What if a user doesn't know what to do?
		A: There should be some button they can click to be redirected to
			 the tutorial page or other page with helpful information..

• Study --> select language
	Q: Should users be able to decide the language they want to study after selecting 'study' exercise?
		A: To simplify it, the user should be in the module of the language they want to study 
			 BEFORE clicking on the 'study' button. They should also have to opportunity to SWITCH LANGUAGE MODULES
			 from the 'study' exercise page, rather than selecting the 'study' exercise language

• Study options --> use recommended video selection 
	# You need to keep track of how many times a user has studied a particular video,
		probably along with other statistics
		Q: What other statistics?
	# You need a function that takes a user's information / activity data, 
		performs an SRS (Spaced-Repetition-Learning-System) calculation,
		and returns a reference to a video resource, which will be the 'recommendation'

• Study options --> choose your own video (not recommended)
	# Bypass the SRS functionality and let the user pick a video
		themselves to study.

• min study time is based on video length. 
	Choose between min and max. 
	Recommended setting is 15~20 minutes
	# You need to read the length of the video after selection,
		and designate 1 play-through as the minimum length for each section of the studying.
			# ex. A video is 2 minutes in length.
						The minimum length for the study session will be 8 minutes.
						Speaking, listening, shadowing, writing are each 2 minutes.
	# Take the length of a video and find a study-time between 15-20 minutes.
		# ex. A video is 2 minutes in length.
					The recommended study time will be 16 minutes.
					2 minutes * 4 sections = 8 minutes of study
					To fit inside the 15 ~ 20 minute recommendation period,
					multiply 8 by 2 to get 16 minutes.
	# Show the user the recommended study time, 
		and allow them to click a button like 'use recommended study time'

• STUDY modules --> common footer / header
	# During the 'study' feature, the current study-session 
		information must be shown in the same place on each screen

• listening -> script auto highlights location 
	# You need to match the speech in a video to a highlighting (selecting?) animation in the displayed text
		Q: What about when you're looking at another language?
			A: Hilighting should be disabled on translated scripts

• listening -> can optionally disable highlighting
	# You need to connect a click event the toggling on / off of the text-hilighting feature

• speaking section
	-> show 1 collocation in header panel
	-> show full script below it in panel
		• highlight collocation
	-> button check mark
	# You need an ARRAY of collocations for a video
	# You need to search for and hilight the collocation within the video script
	# On a click event, you need to create a statistic (record) of that user's study progress

• speaking section
	-> when they complete 1 lap through the collocations, they’ve passed
		• this helps them stay aware of their progress throughout the speaking portion
	# If a video has 5 recommended collocations, have a 0/5, 1/5, 2/5, etc.. progress indicator
		to show the user if they've gone through all the collocations in a script

• speaking section -> If the user has completed all the collocations, 
											they can get plus points for continuing the collocations
	# There should be no upward limit to 'completed collocations' statistic records.. 
		It should just continue to increment as the user completes the task

• writing -> you have to answer a question about the video.
	# For each video, there must exist designated question prompts

• find a conversation partner
	# You need functionality that loops through ALL users and finds users:
			->(who allow their profile to be searched)
			->(who have similar ASL & Interests)
			->(who are studying YOUR native language)
			->(whose NATIVE LANG is the lang you're studying)

• Progress Snapshot 
	-> can see number of study sessions you’ve completed
		# After a user completes a study session, 
			you must increment the 'number of completed sessions,'
			which you must be able to fetch and display elsewhere
	-> can see amount of time you’ve spent studying
		# You must save a record of how much time the user has spent
			performing study-sessions.
		# You can update the 'total time' after each study-unit is completed
			(because the user might not complete the full study session, 
			and you wouldn't want them to have completed SOME and still have '0')
	-> number of collocations you’ve studied
		# For each video studied AT LEAST ONCE,
			combine pre-written collocations + user-added collocations
			to create a 'total collocations studied' value
	-> number of collocations you’ve added
		# There must be a record of 'user-added collocations' per video in user-Q
	-> level (you can have a level)
		# If the user reaches X number of sessions completed, and Y number of time spent studying,
			their 'badge' is increased
		# You need badge graphics
		# You need functionality to automatically CHECK and SET user level
	-> pie chart
		• display % of time spent studying topics in A category
		# You need a PIE chart API
		# You need a function that compares total amount of study time vs
		 	amount of time studying videos in 'A' category, 'B' category, etc..

• Account 
	# user has update & delete privileges about their account information
	-> your profile (with your login info [able to change])
		# You need 'reset password' capability
	-> what you’re interested in (to give recs)
		# You need a list of possible interests (ex. 0 => music, 1 => sports, 2 => culture, etc..)
		# You need a form full of checkboxes with predefined 'interests' / topics
			where the user can add a check to show their interest
		# Based on the user's credentials, you'll need to be able to fetch their interests and fetch 
			(1) video resources whose topics are found within the users' interest array
			(2) other user profile resources with (? 2 or more ?) matching interest to the current user

• Static content
	-> contact us
		# registered users AND guests can send a post request by entering a valid email and a message
		# if a registered user is logged in, hide them email input box
		# You'll need to send the message via email to a specified email address


• how to determine what language a person is studying
	-> Active language
		• allow user to select different language at top
		• once they select a lang, it adds that lang to their ‘active languages’ list
		• in their profile, they can remove a lang from their list

• Cookies
	-> if a guest views a video, plant a cookie 
		 with the video info in their browser and 
		 if they come back, show that video in the main menu
		 # You'll need GET cookie and SET cookie functionality

• Users can 'follow' a speaker and get updates when that speaker has a new video
	# You need to store a users' 'follow' information,
		and send them a message when their target 'follow' creates a new video
