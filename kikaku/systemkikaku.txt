-> Main Ideas
• Website to make studying easier, more efficient & more effective
• You log in and study from this website. 
• choose from a big list of videos
• there are different topics for videos
• videos are in different languages 
• when a user studies, they can see their progress in their profile
• shows the number of days in-a-row that the user has studied in profile
• shows full length of study time in profile
• user can study multiple languages
• put in time you want to study
• pick and choose videos to make your study list
• show scripts and translations for each video
• show recommended collocations for each video
• allow users to add their own collocations to their video 
	but those collocations aren't reflected on other users videos 
• tutorial for beginners
• quick study button to automatically select a video from your playlist based on srs calculation
• recommend me a video form where you can fill out information like your interests, age group, gender to select videos for you 
• native fill in the blank activities (graded based on whether a native speaker would actually say that)
• users can request a video to be made in a certain language about a certain topic
• conversation practice like Skype, you talk to the person in front of you while shadowing the responses, 
	essentially ‘pretending’ to be the person having the conversation
• select site language
• incorporate Jokes / Humor 
• geared toward intermediate / advanced learners who want to become BETTER speakers
• if user is studying multiple languages, they can switch between the languages they’re studying on their profiles
• 'login and go' feeling


• Topic structure
	-> Category -> topic
	-> Business -> separation between work and pleasure


-> Top page
• login
• newest videos (like lynda.com)
	-> topics tabs
		• video icon (date and title)
• quick tips section / useful resources?
• browse videos
	-> can see some videos
	-> can only see a couple videos
	-> can only see 
• footer
	-> about us / support / connect / etc..


-> FAQ page
• study methods
• reason for choosing study methods
• backup research
• how to use the site


-> Create Account
• Setup Questions
	-> what language you wanna study?
	-> what interests
• Tutorial Info


-> Tutorial
• instructions alongside view of study session ( like code academy, etc.. )
• progress through the 4 modules, pausing at each to give explanation 
• tutorial available for anyone, 
• you can see most ( attractive ) features of the website
• interactive tour
• available from sign up menu
• pick language, find a video
• study
	-> each area
		• ex. speaking
				-> show area for people to go to to learn about how to speak effectively
• link to sign up page
• tutorial is broken up into sections (i.e. shadowing, speaking) 
	so that you don’t have to do the whole thing when you only wanna look at 1 part


-> Video Search
• can 絞り込む on speaker gender, age, topic, number of collocations, release date, etc.. (defaults are ‘all’)
• browse videos by:
	-> language
	-> speaker
	-> topic
	-> release date
• list by language
• order by different topics / date added / speaker
• topics about things generally interesting to japanese / english speakers
• search all videos for specific collocations **
	-> i.e., search collocation and list videos with that collocation
• show context next to video (in list) with highlighted search term
• find videos where the speaker uses the phrase XXX
• search videos by difficulty level (?)
• Users can 'follow' a speaker and get updates when that speaker has a new video


-> Show Single Video
• you can slow down the video
• script
	-> always show original language script
	-> able to select translation to view on opposite side
	-> see https://www.lingq.com/learn/sv/workdesk/item/10451511/reader/
• video
• collocations
• place to download video / mp3
• place to add your own collocations
	-> then shows up in ‘your collocations’ section
• place to add this video to your list
• for recommended collocations, there is a brief description 
	(with thesaurus-like description, i.e. ‘pretty’ is like ‘beautiful’) 
	and similar collocations listed beneath 


-> Study
• progress through listening (warmup), shadowing, speaking, writing
• add button somewhere to guide people to go through tutorial or see FAQs if they don’t know what to do
• uninhibited by popups
• before beginning listening, user presses a button to signal they’re ready
• select language
• options
	-> Use ANKI-like SRS to construct daily pattern of study videos
	-> use recommended video selection 
	-> choose your own video (not recommended)
• min study time is based on video length
	-> choose between min and max
	-> recommended setting is 15~20 minutes
• STUDY modules
	-> common footer / header
		• always show ‘times viewed’ and (1:12) <- how long you’ve listened
• speaking section
	-> show 1 collocation in header panel
	-> show full script below it in panel
		• highlight collocation
	-> button check mark
	-> button to skip
	-> after 5 minutes, you’re prompted to move to the next module
	-> speaking portion of study
	-> highlight each collocation and progress through collocations by having the user create and sentence, say it, and click ‘i did it’ to proceed to next collocation
	-> can skip
	-> when they complete 1 lap through the collocations, they’ve passed
		• this helps them stay aware of their progress throughout the speaking portion
	-> probably gotta limit # of collocations on each video
	-> If the user has completed all the collocations, they can get plus points for continuing the collocations
• listening
	-> video + script
	-> script auto highlights location 
		• can optionally disable highlighting
• shadowing
	-> super simple, just video
• writing
	-> you have to answer a question about the video. Be as verbose as possible.
• later, paid members can have their writing analyzed and graded for CHEAP


-> Main Options
• STUDY
• EXCHANGE
	-> chat now function (?)
	-> find a conversation partner
		• based on your profile information,
			find matching conversation partner examples..
				-> you need Age, Sex, Location, Preferred method(s) of study, Interests (as tags)
					• "Don't show my profile as possible conversation partner" <-- to TRUE as default
						-> To allow yourself to be searched, change to FALSE
	-> FUTURE: timed conversation exchanges..
		• eliminates the need to 'fight for speaking time'
	-> challenges
		• goals within a language
			-> example: Business Challenge
			-> increase you business ability in Japanese
			-> Study this amount of material in this much time
	-> Forum
		• different topics
		• anyone can create / post


-> Learning center
• https://www.lingq.com/academy/
• lean about how to learn
• hank’s tips
• how to videos


Playlist
-> you can create multiple playlists
- you populate your Q
	- website recommends when to study what based on your Q
	- all you need to do is click GO


-> Find a conversation partner (the idea of allowing your profile to be searched is better I think)
• if you have an account, fill out a form and post your thing
• like conversationexchange.com


-> Progress Snapshot
• just a little section rather than a complete module
• can see number of study sessions you’ve completed
• can see amount of time you’ve spent studying
• number of collocations you’ve studied
• number of collocations you’ve added
• your last study session
• level (you can have a level)
	-> study sessions that must be completed to make it to the next level?
	-> your level badge
• pie chart with select box above to change language of displayed pie chart
	-> i.e. select spanish -> % of time spent studying topics in A category
	-> select japanese -> % of time spent studying topics in B category


Account
• profile
	-> your profile (with your login info [ able to change ])
	-> contact info (?)
• what you’re interested in (to give recs)
	-> topic list
		• not interested / no opinion / interested
	-> speaker gender / age
	-> lang (obviously)
• email preferences (what to send you .. )
• (later) payment options
• Invite someone link


-> Static content
• contact us page
• FAQs
• system requirements (for videos)
• mimic lynda.com


-> Challenges
• native fill in the blank activities (graded based on whether a native speaker would actually say that)


-> Users Contributions
• contribute videos
• they must provide a script in the original language
• we review it and post it online


LINGQ (how to determine what language a person is studying)
• Active language
	-> allow user to select different language at top
	-> once they select a lang, it adds that lang to their ‘active languages’ list
	-> in their profile, they can remove a lang from their list

-> Cookies
• if a guest views a video, plant a cookie with the video info in their browser and if they come back, show that video in the main menu
